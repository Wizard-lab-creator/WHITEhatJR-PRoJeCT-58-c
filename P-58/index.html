            <p>Hi i am 10 years old i like to play video games like minecraft,roblox. and much more i mostly play these games with my friends from school. but when we fight bosses in minecarft we alwys fight together. because if 1 person is fighting a boss the boss will end him and he will lose all his stuff or items. We somtimes mess around and end each other but we always get revenge. and somtimes we just laugh if someone gets ended by a mob such as enderman,zombie,creeper,pigman,hoglen,spider,skeleton,slime and much more. so thats almost all the mobs but remember minecraft is very good.
